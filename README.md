# ESP8266 Force Sensor Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface a force sensor with an ESP8266 microcontroller to measure the force applied to the sensor and display the corresponding voltage on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Force Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard (optional)**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Force Sensor to ESP8266:**
   - **VCC:** Connect to the 3.3V pin on the ESP8266.
   - **GND:** Connect to the GND pin on the ESP8266.
   - **OUT:** Connect to the A0 pin (Analog Input) on the ESP8266.

#### Instructions
1. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support installed.
   - Install the necessary libraries if required.
   - Create a new sketch and paste the provided Arduino code.
   - Connect the ESP8266 to your computer, select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

2. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor.
   - You should see the analog value and corresponding voltage printed every 500 milliseconds.

#### Applications
- **Weight Measurement:** Measure weight or force in various applications such as digital scales.
- **Pressure Sensing:** Monitor and measure pressure applied to surfaces in robotics or industrial applications.
- **Human-Machine Interaction:** Use force sensors in interfaces to detect touch pressure in human-machine interaction systems.

#### Notes
- **Sensor Calibration:** Calibrate the force sensor based on the specific characteristics of your sensor to ensure accurate measurements.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure a stable power supply to the ESP8266 and the force sensor.
- **Analog Reading:** Adjust the voltage reference and mapping if using a different analog-to-digital conversion setup.
